# Model selection (cost vs quality trade-off)
# Options:
#   - gpt-4o-mini      : $0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens (RECOMMENDED - cheap & good)
#   - gpt-4o           : $2.50/$10.00 per 1M tokens (faster, better)
#   - gpt-4-turbo      : $10.00/$30.00 per 1M tokens (most expensive)

# Temperature (0.0 = focused, 1.0 = creative)
# Lower = less tokens used, more consistent output

# Max tokens for response (limits cost per request)
